Guidelines for how to write and structure game content and plots in Word, Google Docs or similar to facilitate extraction of game data for use in scripts, macros, virtual tabletops etc.

RPG Markup is based on guidelines laid out in [RPG Markdown](https://github.com/innergnome/rpg-markdown).

## Purpose

- A common agreement of expected input and output when you import and export RPG content to a VTT, RPG editor, RPG Wiki or similar
- An agreement on how to structure game data that exist within RPG source books and modules

## The basics

> TODO: Finish this one

- Use header tags and use them correctly; H2 follows the H1 tag, H3 follows H2 tags etc.
- No more than one H1 header in a document
- If a bold text could be a header, use header with the correct level
- Simple tables only (no merged cells, multi level headers)
- Style text with italic and bold, no strikethrough, underline, different font size and font types

## Export and import

### Convert to markdown
